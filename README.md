# Updated-portfolio
I’m Kiruthika . I’ve recently started studying HTML and CSS and have successfully created my first website, marking the beginning of my journey in web design and development.

## Skill Development
"I created a simple portfolio website using HTML and CSS, featuring two pages: a Home page that introduces me and my background, and a Contact page where visitors can reach out to me. This project marks my first step into web development, and I’m excited to continue learning and improving my skills!"
